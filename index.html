<p>The first documented cycling race was a 1,200 metre race held on May 31, 1868 at the Park of Saint-Cloud, Paris. It was won by expatriate Englishman James Moore who rode a bicycle with solid rubber tires.[3] The first cycle race covering a distance between two cities was Parisâ€“Rouen, also won by James Moore, who rode the 123 kilometres dividing both cities in 10 hours and 40 minutes.[4]

The oldest established bicycle racing club in the United States is the St. Louis Cycling Club. Operating continuously since 1887, the club has sponsored races and timed distance events since its inception. Its members have included numerous national champions and Olympic team members.
